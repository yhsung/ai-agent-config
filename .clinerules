# Cline/Roo Code Agent Rules
# Configuration for AI-assisted development

## Language-Specific Rules

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function signatures and class attributes
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting
- Use pathlib for file system operations instead of os.path
- Write docstrings in Google or NumPy format
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic models for data structures
- Implement proper error handling with specific exception types
- Use context managers (with statements) for resource management
- Prefer async/await for I/O operations when applicable
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose (max 50 lines)

### Go
- Follow official Go style guide and formatting (gofmt)
- Use meaningful variable names (avoid single letters except in loops)
- Implement proper error handling - always check errors
- Use interfaces for abstraction and testability
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write table-driven tests
- Document exported functions, types, and packages
- Use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts
- Keep packages focused with clear responsibilities
- Avoid global state when possible

### Rust
- Follow Rust API guidelines and formatting (rustfmt)
- Embrace ownership and borrowing - avoid unnecessary clones
- Use Result and Option types instead of panicking
- Implement proper error handling with thiserror or anyhow
- Write comprehensive documentation comments (///)
- Use meaningful type names and avoid excessive abbreviations
- Prefer iterator chains over explicit loops
- Implement traits for common operations
- Use cargo clippy recommendations
- Write unit tests alongside implementation code

## General Coding Standards

### Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)
- Remove dead code and unused imports
- Use meaningful commit messages (conventional commits format)

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80% for critical paths
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Validate and sanitize all external inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

### Documentation
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep README files up to date
- Include usage examples in documentation
- Document API endpoints with request/response examples
- Maintain a CHANGELOG for significant changes

## AI Agent Behavior

### Code Generation
- Prefer modifying existing code over creating new files
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest multiple approaches for complex problems
- Consider performance implications of generated code
- Flag potential security issues or anti-patterns

### Code Review
- Check for edge cases and error handling
- Verify code follows language-specific conventions
- Identify potential performance bottlenecks
- Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
- Ensure tests cover the changes

### Debugging
- Analyze error messages and stack traces systematically
- Check for common issues first (null references, off-by-one, etc.)
- Suggest adding logging or debugging output
- Consider race conditions in concurrent code
- Verify assumptions with data validation

## Project-Specific Preferences
# Add your project-specific rules below:

# Example:
# - Use SQLAlchemy for database operations in Python
# - Prefer slog for logging in Go
# - Use tokio for async runtime in Rust
